Interactive search of Brazilian states using the Elm programming language

To test the html we just use the elm reactor command inside the directory, and then we can access the link [](url) http://localhost:8000

To generate the html file we use elm-make, using the following way:
```
elm-make Main.elm --output=main.html
```
done so just open main.html in your browser and you will have access to the file.
